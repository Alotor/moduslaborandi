This past week, I was completely absorbed by the [PIWeek](http://www.piweek.com/). This is the 8th edition, and we still feel motivated when starts the PIWeek. Participants are still exhausted after the 5 days, and of course, happy! All the even editions coincide (not by chance) with the anniversary of Kaleidos. Happy 4th b-day for all of us!!

This year, I made a team with awsome colleages: Pablo ([@_pabloalba_](http://twitter.com/_pabloalba_)), Miguel ([@mgdelacroix](http://twitter.com/mgdelacroix)), Laura ([@_laurapareja_](http://twitter.com/_laurapareja_)), and me fromed the team **ZOMBIE TIME!**.

Zombie time! is a multiplayer game, based on the rules of different boardgames. The protagonists are the _survivors_ trying to achive collaborative missions, while fighting the zombies. As it was _our_ game, Laura made caricatures of ourselves to be the survivors, the heroes!!!

I joined the team without knowing too much about the rules or the idea, but soon I was contributing with the domain model, and creating the base data. On wednesday I moved to the front team where I took lots of _iocaine_ doses: [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templates, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [ES6](es6-features.org/), tools that I hadn't used before. I learned a lot! But most important, I really enjoyed building something so fast, with this great team.

Following one of the rules of Piweek, the code (don't read it! it was an hectic week ;-)) is available in in github, both [front](http://github.com/PIWEEK/zombie-time-front) and [back](http://github.com/PIWEEK/zombie-time-back) projects.

As it happens during PIWeek, we almost didn't sleep, but we laughed so much that it was worth.

We presented 13 projects of all kinds: a collection of [minerals](http://mineralis.pythonanywhere.com/), a sharing-ideas platform to empower the citicens, the [definitive platform](http://uxbox.github.io) for prototyping, an attempt to solve a [mathematical problem](https://github.com/PIWEEK/polygon) (next time!), a platform to share 3d models, more [video games](https://github.com/PIWEEK/guild-empire-core), and much much more... and open source!!

Piweek is an awsome event in Kaleidos, and we are glad to have with us some [colleagues](http://fmartingr.com/blog/2015/07/18/piweek-viii/) from [other](http://www.eferro.net/2015/07/piweek-edicion-viii-cuarto-dia.html) companies or cities. Innovation is in the air!!
