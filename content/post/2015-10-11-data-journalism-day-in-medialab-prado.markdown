This past saturday I attended the conference [Jornada de herramientas cartográficas. Mapas de elecciones](http://www.meetup.com/Madrid-Periodismo-de-datos-Meetup/events/225441850/) in [Medialab Prado](http://medialab-prado.es/). It was a conference to show cartographic (and open!) tools to those who are intersted in data visualization with maps.

<!-- more -->

During the conference they enabled a [titanpad](https://electionmaps.titanpad.com/1) to add more resources.

First session was a large introduction by [Santiago Higuera](https://twitter.com/santiagohiguera) to the **communities** of [GeoInquietos](https://twitter.com/geoinquietosMad) (people intersted in cartography and data visualization). Here you can see the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RfS1qV7091w01JGfnbSsi3uQtmZNzpOXPg2WxS0s9KE/edit#gid=0).

Next session by [Jorge Sanz](https://twitter.com/xurxosanz) was about the huge amount of **open source software for GIS** and data visualization. Very exhaustive in my opinion, but here you can see the [presentation](http://slides.com/danielegraso/deck/#/) with lots of resources.

In the third talk, [Daniele Grasso](http://twitter.com/danielegrasso), journalist in El Confidencial, talked us about [Maps and Data Journalism](http://slides.com/danielegraso/deck/#/).

Forth session, by [Adrián Blanco](https://twitter.com/AdrianBlancoR/) was a [quick tutorial](http://adrianblanco.github.io/leafletjs-tutorial/#/) about how to create a map with [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/). Very simple and too quick; I'd have appreciated to have a longer workshop.

In the afternoon, [Graeme Herbert](http://twitter.com/red_baobab) talked to us about simulations of elections with maps. Also a quick workshop with qgis and a talk about customization of an old friend, CartoDB.

Finally, [Carlos Gil Bellosta](http://twitter.com/gilbellosta) gave us a talk titled "About an antropocentric cartography". A very interesting approach to cartography as a user: does cartography need to be accurate to be good? And then [Beatriz Martínez](http://visualizados.com) gave as a quick tutorial about how to build maps with RStudio.

Conclusion: good talks, speakers who really knew their topic, so they could answer many questions, the environment was informal and nice. In my opinion, the conference was a bit too ambitious, so we could barely taste the tools we were using; workshops need to be longer. Besides, the organizers weren't stricts with the schedule so the last talk was hectic. That said, I really enjoyed the conference; the best thing was the amount of resources that I could gather. I'll try something with maps in my next Piweek.

From a gender point of view:
- speakers: male 8 / female 3
- attendees: in the morning, cleary more women than men; and in the afternoon there was a more equal distribution.
